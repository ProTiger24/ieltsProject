                content: `Marine biology is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean or other marine bodies of water. Marine biologists study everything from microscopic plankton to the largest whales. The ocean covers about 71% of the Earth's surface and contains 97% of the Earth's water. Marine life plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and producing oxygen through photosynthesis. Understanding marine ecosystems is essential for conservation efforts.`,
